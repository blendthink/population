Add an id\n         * in the series configuration options, and get the series object by\n         * {@link Highcharts.Chart#get}.\n         *\n         * Configuration options for the series are given in three levels. Options for\n         * all series in a chart are given in the\n         * [plotOptions.series](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series)\n         * object. Then options for all series of a specific type\n         * are given in the plotOptions of that type, for example `plotOptions.line`.\n         * Next, options for one single series are given in the series array, or as\n         * arguments to `chart.addSeries`.\n         *\n         * The data in the series is stored in various arrays.\n         *\n         * - First, `series.options.data` contains all the original config options for\n         *   each point whether added by options or methods like `series.addPoint`.\n         *\n         * - Next, `series.data` contains those values converted to points, but in case\n         *   the series data length exceeds the `cropThreshold`, or if the data is\n         *   grouped, `series.data` doesn't contain all the points. It only contains the\n         *   points that have been created on demand.\n         *\n         * - Then there's `series.points` that contains all currently visible point\n         *   objects. In case of cropping, the cropped-away points are not part of this\n         *   array. The `series.points` array starts at `series.cropStart` compared to\n         *   `series.data` and `series.options.data`. If however the series data is\n         *   grouped, these can't be correlated one to one.\n         *\n         * - `series.xData` and `series.processedXData` contain clean x values,\n         *   equivalent to `series.data` and `series.points`.\n         *\n         * - `series.yData` and `series.processedYData` contain clean y values,\n         *   equivalent to `series.data` and `series.points`.\n         *\n         * @class\n         * @name Highcharts.Series\n         *\n         * @param {Highcharts.Chart} chart\n         * The chart instance.\n         *\n         * @param {Highcharts.SeriesOptionsType|object} options\n         * The series options.\n         */\n        var Series = /** @class */ (function () {\n                function Series() {\n                    /* *\n                     *\n                     *  Static Properties\n                     *\n                     * */\n                    this._i = void 0;\n                this.chart = void 0;\n                this.data = void 0;\n                this.eventOptions = void 0;\n                this.eventsToUnbind = void 0;\n                this.index = void 0;\n                this.linkedSeries = void 0;\n                this.options = void 0;\n                this.points = void 0;\n                this.processedXData = void 0;\n                this.processedYData = void 0;\n                this.tooltipOptions = void 0;\n                this.userOptions = void 0;\n                this.xAxis = void 0;\n                this.yAxis = void 0;\n                this.zones = void 0;\n                /** eslint-enable valid-jsdoc */\n            }\n            /* *\n             *\n             *  Functions\n             *\n             * */\n            /* eslint-disable valid-jsdoc */\n            Series.prototype.init = function (chart, userOptions) {\n                fireEvent(this, 'init', { options: userOptions });\n                var series = this,\n                    chartSeries = chart.series;\n                // The 'eventsToUnbind' property moved from prototype into the\n                // Series init to avoid reference to the same array between\n                // the different series and charts. #12959, #13937\n                this.eventsToUnbind = [];\n                /**\n                 * Read only.
